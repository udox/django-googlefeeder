# Google Shopping Feed

## Django based feed creator with sample

### Outline

Code from [Tom Viner](https://github.com/tomviner) to provide a Google
Product feed for your own models. Do notuse _as is_ because it won't
work nor match your models! The `google.py` filecan be used entirely
on it's own (with django!).

The `feeds.py` file is provided for reference to see how to combine that
with djangos built in RSS capability to provide a full product feed for your
application.There are some caveats to bear in mind so we provide comments and
refs within it.
